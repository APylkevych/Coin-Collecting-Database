# Coin-Collection-Database
Test database
It was created to fulfill a set of tasks.   
The goal was to demonstrate the ability to use different approaches to work with data   
(what the work should contain was determined by the project manager; the corresponding requirements were implemented)   

At the moment, only the program code remains without documentation.  
If found, it will be added for better understanding.
